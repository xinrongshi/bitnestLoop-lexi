  "circulation_li_title1":"What is Bit Loop?",
  "circulation_li_conent1":"BitLoop is a blockchain-native smart contract designed for lending and borrowing. Built upon the Ethereum network (EVM), it functions as a currency market lending protocol. Users can securely provide or borrow cryptocurrencies without exposure to risk. The BitLoop smart contract protocol seamlessly matches short-term borrowers with lenders, facilitating decentralized capital flow and generating loan agreement orders. This framework enables a range of blockchain lending activities and operates exclusively on blockchain technology, eliminating reliance on centralized institutions. Peer-to-peer lending among users is executed through smart contracts, ensuring rapid, cost-effective transactions and yielding superior returns relative to traditional avenues.",
  "circulation_li_title2":"How does Bit Loop make a profit?",
  "circulation_li_conent2":"BitLoop utilizes blockchain-based smart lending contract protocols to provide a platform for borrowers in need of short-term funds and lenders, benefiting all participants through diversified capital flows. For example, User A, requiring short-term funds, initiates a loan through BitLoop's smart contract, paying a 1.5% capital supply dividend and pledging the corresponding cryptocurrency assets; User B participates in the lending circulation. The smart contract automatically pairs and processes orders, completing the capital supply. If User B's investment is insufficient to meet User A's needs, the system will combine multiple orders to complete the transaction. At the end of the loan, 0.7% of the capital supply dividend paid by User A is distributed to User B as a return, with the remaining 0.8% awarded to the initiator as a 17th generation share reward.",
  "circulation_li_title3":"How does the Bit Loop work?",
  "circulation_li_conent3":"BitLoop employs leading broadcast technology and secure smart contract technology to generate a dividend pool via algorithms, aggregating participants' funds and interacting with borrower order agreements. Funds are distributed point-to-point to the borrower's wallet through smart contracts, ensuring zero risk to capital. When market users initiate a loan order, the smart contract creates 100 anonymous regulatory nodes and two regulatory private keys, automatically processing the transaction orders. Using multi-signature technology and point-to-point financial practices for security, the smart contract manages operations automatically. All data is executed on the public blockchain, ensuring independent operation and automatic crediting of earnings to wallets.",
  "circulation_li_title4":"Bit Loop security?",
  "circulation_li_conent4":"BitLoop's mission is to provide the highest level of security for its users. The underlying operational model is an autonomous program that runs indefinitely and cannot be controlled by anyone, including its creators. All transactions are executed peer-to-peer, directly from one individual wallet to another, or multiple wallets. There is no need to 'exit' because the funds are already in your wallet, tamper-proof even by founders and developers due to the irreversible nature of smart contracts. BitLoop smart contracts ensure the security of private keys and verify each transaction. In essence, these contracts provide robust security and a user-friendly experience, allowing you full control of your assets so you can enjoy the benefits of decentralized finance as long as the internet exists.",
  "circulation_li_title5":"How to get Bit Loop sharing rewards?",
  "circulation_li_conent5":"At BitLoop, your commission profits stem from your partners. From the moment you join BitLoop's smart contract, it creates a unique personal link for you. When your partners use this link to join BitLoop, they become your direct downstream partners and are permanently linked to you. All individual partners you invite are permanently assigned to you and cannot be changed, as the data is recorded on the blockchain. Moreover, your referral link remains unchanged; you cannot alter your upline partners. When your partners complete their participation in the BitLoop circulation cycle, the smart contract automatically distributes the corresponding share of rewards to your wallet.",

When the countdown of the order ends, the smart contract will automatically return the assets to the user's wallet address.",
  "join_text1":"The smart contract begins to operate from the moment it receives the circulating crypto assets from participants, and calculates the order needs of lenders and suppliers based on real-time wallet address count (a), capital circulation volume (b), capital return volume (c), number of loan orders (t), loan amount (s), repayment amount (f), historical fluctuation range (d), linear cycle (n), etc., and provides a capital supply agreement (x), automatically matching both parties' needs and completing the transaction.",
  "join_text2":"To ensure that participants can steadily receive dividends, the BitLoop smart contract implements circulation volume control related to the crypto assets pledged by the market stakeholders. If the borrower's pledged crypto assets are insufficient, participants will not be able to provide funds to the smart contract’s liquidity pool for circulation. In such cases, the smart contract will automatically reject any funds exceeding the participant's supply order from circulating into the liquidity pool, ensuring absolute safety.",

Solve the problem of high interest rates and high thresholds for borrowing in developing countries. In France, the annual interest rate for loans is 1.8 per cent; in Germany, the annual interest rate for loans is 2.6 per cent; and even in the United Kingdom, the annual interest rate for loans is only 4 per cent. However, in developing countries, the interest rate on loans is very high, with the annual interest rate on loans in India at 8%, in Turkey at 12%, in Colombia at 19%, in Brazil at 30%, and in China, the annual interest rate on private loans is even more than 36%. In this highly irrational financial environment, the lending industry does not serve everyone equally, which would be a serious deviation from the original purpose of the industry. What BitLoop is doing is changing the trajectory of traditional lending and borrowing, reviving Muhammad's original vision for the sector and making it more relevant to today's times. Through the BitLoop Smart Borrowing Protocol, it provides ample supply of funds to those who can afford it but lack liquid funds.</span></div><div class='image-text_3 flex-row justify-between'><img class='thumbnail_img' referrerpolicy='no-referrer' src='/reward_intro_img.png' /><span class='text-group_3'>At the same time, it is equally important for the capital suppliers to get stable dividends.

Use custom links not only to register partners for yourself, but also to send some links to your beginners so they can practice and start learning how to work with new partners.</p></div><div class='textGradient h2'><img class='thumbnail_img' src='/reward_intro_img.png' />Me + bit nest = the whole big world</div><div class='rounds simpleP' style='padding: 20px;'><p class='gray'>BitPower removes one of the most important barriers to business growth-the language barrier.
